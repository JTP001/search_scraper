# search_scraper
Youtube API mini project that scrapes the youtube search bar results for videos containing a keyword and makes a playlist with them. 

This program was made for my personal interest and for practice using an APi I've never tried before. There is little to no bug or error checking, but it works if the values given are those expected.

This program requires an API key saved as api_key.json and a client secret saved as client_secret.json to run. They must be generated individually by going to the google api developer console.
